Task 02 - Create a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.
Given Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python/data?select=Mall_Customers.csv

K-means clustering algorithm - It is an unsupervised machine learning pattern that can be used to find pateerns in a dataset, in this algorithm we are not trying to predict something as in other ai model training but instead we are tying to find patterns in the data which is done by feeding the data to the algorithm. It is an iterative algorithm - basically it updates until it gets to its final cluster assignment.

Cluster - Clusters are basically block of data that have similarities
